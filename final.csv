I've been alone for too long
Did you want me just to welcome you

Falling for your charms?

That's how I lived my life
Always searching for rainbows

You've been away for far too long
And I've been alone for too long

Around the corners of my mind
But you keep getting further
Further every time

Everyday I travel, travel in time
Try my best to reach you
I just don't know what I'll find
Everyday I travel
Everyday you lie
Everyday it's harder
Harder to forgive

You've been away for too long
I've been alone for too long
Looking out for shadows
Thinking of you
Chasing after shadows

The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Around and around, the refrain
rings the same each time it's heard
Entertain the notion, that the only thing I hear
Is the crack of a smile, in a face that ain't so sincere

It is only as deep as your modesty

As your insides fall to pieces
Shattered by the silent treatment
Things are only fragile till they break
Feigning your humility
It only serves to weaken the
Most common observations that you make
Drown me out in conversation
Surf a wave of provocation
Wash away my interest in your wake

Could he maybe find time to give the D-E-L a lift
He said it is impossible because he has a roster full of plans for the day

I waited at the bus stop feeling kinda high
From a spliff that I smoked, I riffed and provoked
A little scene when the bus arrived late like a joke
With a corny punchline, and it was only lunchtime
The bus should've been here, the driver had much time
To get is act together, no matter what the weather
Now I'm sittin' at the bus stop waitin' like forever

I'm getting sick and tired of the wait

And bad attitudes and I wasn't in the mood

Tried to walk away from it but it called me back
Forget my pride shit I even quit my job
For the one that I love to work music
Recognized by my art that I spill in my game
Pour my heart on the track and have you feeling my pain
Seen a lot of hard times on the way to success
When I'm mad writing a rhyme is my way to express
Lay back and fall deep in a verse
If I was out in the street yo I probably lay a sleep in a hearse
There's nothing like when you on a mic tearing a track
Then you come from out the booth and start hearing it back

So in my soup I used to get
All the letters of the alphabet
I learned them all from A to Z
And now my Mother's giving me

Animal crackers in my soup
Monkeys and rabbits loop the loop
Gosh, oh gee! but I have fun
Swallowing animals one by one

In every bowl of soup I see
Lions and tigers watching me
I make 'em jump right through a hoop
Those animal crackers in my soup

When I get hold of the big bad wolf
I just push him under to drown
Then I bite him in a million bits
And I gobble him right down!

When they're inside me where it's dark
I walk around like Noah's Ark
I stuff my tummy like a goop
With animal crackers in my soup!

Animal crackers in my soup
Do funny things to me
They make me think my neighborhood
Is a big menagerie

For instance, there's our Janitor
His name is Mr. Klein
And when he hollers at us kids
He reminds me of a lion

The grocer is so big and fat
He has a big mustache
He looks just like a walrus
Just before he takes a splash!",Animal Crackers in My Soup,['disgust'],20706,Unknown,{'disgust': 0.36447498202323914}

Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
You've had time to think about it for a while.

Well, I've walked over two hundred miles, look me over
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high
It won't matter who loves who
You'll love me or I'll love you

When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting
Sorrow covers you up like a cape
Only yesterday I know you've been flirting
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.

I can't provide for you no easy answers
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You'll know all about it,love
It'll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
You must have been protecting someone last time I called
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver
I've never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.

I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
For the love of a lousy buck, I've watched them die
Stick around, baby, we're not through
Don't look for me, I'll see you
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky.

In your teardrops, I can see my reflection
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line
I don't want to be a fool starving for affection
I don't want to drown in someone else's wine.

For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that's howling in your eye
You will seek me and you'll find me
In the wasteland of your mind 
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky.

Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
When you were gambling for support
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
When my memory is not so short.

This time I'm asking for freedom
Freedom from a world which you deny
And you'll give it to me now
I'll take it anyhow

32221,Joni Mitchell,"Although I speak in tongues
Of men and angels
I'm just sounding brass
And tinkling cymbals without love-

Love suffers long-
Love is kind!-
Enduring all things-
Love has no evil in mind

If I had the gift of prophecy-
And all the knowledge-
And the faith to move the mountains
Even if I understood all of the mysteries-
If I didn't have love
I'd be nothing

Love-never looks for love-
Love's not puffed up-
Or envious-
Or touchy-
Because it rejoices in the truth
Not in iniquity
Love sees like a child sees

As a child I spoke as a child-
I thought and I understood as a child-
But when I became a woman-
I put away childish things
And began to see through a glass darkly

Where, as a child, I saw it face to face
Now, I only know it in part
Fractions in me
Of faith and hope and love
And of these great three
Love's the greatest beauty

She was beggin' to be mine, but my job was on the line
Should I say or should I go? I just didn't know... Hmmmm

I left fifty kids standin' in line, they were whining, they were crying
and their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and I swear
I never heard such profanity

I dropped my suit on the floor
they were trying to block the door
They were calling her a whore
They were driven to nativities insanity

She wasn't lookin' to become my wife
She said, ""I hope you understand
I just want a nightful of man, Sonny""

She didn't notice I was thin with a delicate chin
Nor the softness of my skin, nor the scent of my other personalities
She didn't see through my disguise - didn't see it in my eyes
She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality

She said ""Come and lay down on the floor with me
It's warmer here by the fire""
She didn't know that there was more of me
She'd have to learn to love all four of me

Sitting on a coffin drinking coffee
I wore black on black with negative feelings
I often go to Paris to live yesterday tomorrow
Because Paris is a place of dreams

Juliette Greco, Jeanne Moreau and Catherine Deneuve
And I'm walking with Eric Satie
Along the boulevards of Paris in the springtime

Drifting through these landscapes of love
Watching strays from Pere Lacheise

Can you hear the cats purr?
Can you hear the master?
Stone against their velvet fur

Girls who travel the metro
Stroking white mice they carry in their pockets
Lost in a day dream

Hurtling myself down into the metro

Turns my day into night

Sailing in my head
You swim my secret oceans
Of coral blue and red

It reaches through my skin
Moving from within

See you in my dreams

Somewhere in my sleep
Got me spinning round and round

Your shadow's disappeared
Your breath is just a sea mist
Surrounding my body
I'm working through the daytime

I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand

I'll love you more than anybody can.

And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time
The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime.

I'll be there when you're feeling down
To kiss away the tears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
A reflection of the love in your eyes.

They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock

I learn about taste through your lips
I learn about trust through your lies

The only thing I need

The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

Why is there so much violence?

In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed

But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year

I wonder who's kissing her now
I wonder who's teaching her how
I wonder who's looking into her eyes
Breathing sighs, telling lies

To love

Then a boy breaks a girl's heart
A girl breaks a boy's heart
Goodbye is a very hard word to forget
But I think I finally met
The girl

To take away those yesterdays
Oh she loves me, she told me so
As a tear came to her eye
And I love her, I will, I know
Love her for the rest of my life
Once more I'm feeling like I'm out of control
'Cause the girl's got a serious hold
On me

And part of me says run away
But I want to stay
Should I be up front or cool
Which way is playing the fool
The only time I know what's right
Is when I hear her telling me
Somewhere there's a star in the sky of every night
Shining for the love of hearts
The light of that star, like the hand of a friend
Leading me back to love again
If you love her let her know
Let her see all the secrets in your heart
If she loves you she'll only love you more

54711,Bal-Sagoth,"[The Oracle of Logres:]
It was a time of change. The descendants of the Atlantean mages had fallen
before the New Praesidium, and the wolves were baying at the Empire's door.
An oppressive new faith was encroaching from the east, and the sylvan liege
had locked tight the gates of his arboreal realm. And so it was that towards
the end of the Age of Mystery, the last of Albion's great Dragon Lords did
gather for what would be their final battle...

[The War-song of the Dragon Lords:]
Dragon-phalanx rend the sky, Albion our gleaming prize,
Sentinels of land and sea, guardians of destiny.
(Prowling amongst the pecseatan; Draconis Bipedes, swift and furious beast of battle!)

[The Dragon King's Vow:]
(Dragon-Runes etched by the firey tongues of the IX Legio Draconis into the
primordial stone of the great Logres Drachenstahl Cromlech):
The foes of this sceptred isle shall be driven back into the sea!
An oath sworn in battle, a vow blessed by steel,
I swear by the dragon's blood in my veins... and the dragon's heart that pumps
it!

[The War-song of the Dragon Lords:]
Dragonfyre in the fray, faith and steel shall win the day,
A god to serf and king alike, the Adamantine Hammer strikes!
(Devouring the infidel outlanders; Draconis Nematoda, great winged worm of war!)

[The Dragon King's Vow:]
To victory eternal... this world shall be our empire!
Dragon Imperium, throne of the Ancient Gods, behold the axiom, Wyruld-Cyninga!
It is time! We shall rule, and upon our dominion the sun shall never set!

[12 October: 1893]
I must commit this to the pages of my journal, while it is still vivid in my
recollection... not that such a macabre vision could possibly soon be
blissfully forgotten. Just before dawn, I awoke from a fantastic and somewhat
horrifying dream in which I traversed a great black cyclopean cityscape,
its towering stygian walls inscribed with some form of outlandish glyphs which
seemed to writhe squamously and alter their shape even as I gazed at them.
A sibilant whispering which seemed at once familiar and yet intrusively alien
compelled me to walk to the edge of a particularly sinister looking edifice
and peer out over its precipitous perimeter. When I did so, I beheld this
world of ours, recognizing vaguely the apparent shapes of the five continents,
yet the entire vista seemed so distant that the whole appeared in its entirety
no larger than a sphere which I could fit snugly into the palm of my hand.
When I turned again to behold the looming obelisks, I found I could then
easily read the previously untranslatable ciphers in the black stone. They
were the words of a great thaumaturgist who had seemingly discovered a
repository of aeons-old lore detailing the sidereal web of the cosmos, with
arcane diagrams pinpointing certain astral portals and places of empyreal
potency, a sort of pangalactic ley-line chart, if you will. Indeed, these
Star-Maps Of The Ancient Cosmographers seemed to take a not insignificant toll
on the author's sanity, as evidenced by the tone of his inscriptions, which
seem to suggest that in discovering this Pandora's Box of dark elucidation,
his fate was to be inexorably dogged by some nameless and implacable gloom;",Draconis Albionensis,['fear'],34708,symphonic black metal,{'fear': 0.8909023404121399}

I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama

Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggaz cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' the steel
Read my will my boys get it all no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump off is off limits

Once I settled in you made me a gentleman

She look Wall Street briefcase, pen strife suit
The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me

He was better off dead, than slow in the head. His momma and poppa had taken a ride on his back, so he left very quickly to join The Pack. 


I see faces and traces of home back in New York City -
So you think I'm a tough kid? Is that what you heard?
Well I like to see some action and it gets into my blood.

I'm the pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain
'Cause we're only as strong, yes we're only as strong,
As the weakest link in the chain.


Only after a spell in Pontiac reformatory was he given any respect in the gang. 

Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen,

I don't care who I hurt, I don't care who I do wrong.
This is your mess I'm stuck in, I really don't belong.
When I take out my bottle, filled up high with gasoline,
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been.


Now, walking back home after a raid, he was cuddling a sleeping porcupine.
That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompaniment of very romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous stainless steel razor. 


As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame, but me.
Held my heart, deep in hair,
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.
No time for romantic escape,
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!
Off we go...

You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel.

But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash.

And laid them down in coloured sheets (laid them down in coloured

Sweet love strictly
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul, your heart, and your mind
In your hour of need girl, I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love

[Chorus]

Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
Candy girl
All I want to say
(Word is bond sweetheart)
I need your love
(I swear I'm down for whatever)

Look so sweet

45179,Sheila Nicholls,"Hannah's friends were watching
When she met him at the end of the bar
Hannah's friends were thinking
That he wouldn't even make it that far

""This is for you"", he said
Her gaze unbroken as she licked her spoon
He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the moon
He gave it to her

Her breathing stumbled and her eyes became wide
And as she swallowed cream
She could already feel him inside
She'd seen similar before

A book, a ring, a key, and more
But never as clever and as clean and as pure
And he said, ""You're the one

You're the only one I've been waiting for""
So she took his eyes and trusted
And they slipped through the door

Texas girl in New York, don't call her naive
Though she's seen it before, she just risks to believe
She still has the faith in her battered ideals and she

She still holds the courage to scale her fears
Well, spontaneous love has crossed everyone's mind
Most lose hope when that's not what we find

I saw her in the morning and she was crying in the park
She said his girlfriend came home and screamed through the dark
She said that she called her a whore and then she spat in her face
So, Hannah had left in silent disgrace

And then she turned to be, she said, ""Now what do I do?""
And I witnessed her shame, how it was mine too
And now she even calls him from Texas, she gets his machine
He made her question herself, her worth, her esteem

So, don't say she's the one and then forget
Don't hand her the moon and then charge interest on debt now
Don't give her your lines 'cause your mask may be flawless
But you're full of shit and your campaign is coreless

And the moon won't do if it's just a snapshot
And hell neither will you if that's all that you got now
Neither will you if that's all that you got now
Neither will you if that's all that you got now
Neither will you if that's all that you got

Texas girl in New York, don't call her naive
Though she's seen it all before, she just risks to believe
Well, she still has the faith in her battered ideals and she

She still has the courage to scale her fears

35158,Willie Nelson,"Once I knowed a guitar picker, lived his life on wine and liquor
Runnin' around in one of them new machines
He was about the proudest feelin', wheelin', dealin'
Sneakin', stealin', aggravatin' man I've ever seen

Nothin' but a midnight rambler, biggest drunkard and a gambler
He'd do anything that wasn't nice
Huntin', golfin', fishin', swimmin', runnin' around with other women
Playin' dominoes and shootin' dice

Then one night as he was dinin', while the moon was brightly shinin'
With his secret love he was so gay
He would laugh and call her 'Honey' while she proudly spent his money
As they hugged and smooched the time away

Laughin', jokin', dinin', dancin'
Plannin' parties and romancin', havin' fun regardless of the price
Eatin' caviar and chicken, strummin' his guitar and pickin'
Playin' dominoes and shootin' dice

Then his wife walked in and found him with that pretty girl around him
Started makin' headway for the gate
When he seen those girls dividin', he commenced to slip and slidin'
But he seemed to know it was too late

Crowds began to gettin' thinner, they jumped up and left their dinner
No one seemed to have an appetite
Not a person dare defend her, everyone jumped out the window
No one hung around to see the fight

Then she grabbed him by the collar, he commenced to squeal and holler
As she plastered him betwixt the eyes
And then his old guitar she swung it, o'er his head she proudly hung it
Bruises, knots and bumps began to rise

He leapt up and tried to squeeze her, but she warped 'cross the beezer
Pulled a pistol and shot him once or twice
When the wicked fight was over, he was laid beneath the clover

Oxygenates the muscles as they rile
And breed rage out of cavity

That's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play
And now that I wander
My thoughts ever stray

South of the border down Mexico way
Ah, she was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face
It was fiesta we were so gay

South of the border down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered manana
Never dreamed that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered manana

For tomorrow never came
South of the border I jumped backed one day
There in a veil of white by the candle light knelt to pray
Ah, the mission bells told me that I must not stay

30605,Bill Anderson,"When I first heard this song, I was a little boy growing up
Down in the state of South Carolina
The song had been written and recorded by a man named
T. Texas Tyler

The song in it's original form related to something that
Happened during the second World War
Last year, early in 1991, when things were going kinda crazy
Over on the other side of the world, I remembered this old song

And I rewrote the first part of it to fit the situation
The second part of it I left like it's been all of these years
Because you can't improve upon perfection
I'd like to dedicate this tonight to all the Veterans

To their families, their loved ones
And everybody that loves this country

It was a sweltering hot Sunday morning in the Saudi Arabian desert
And a young soldier sat alone in his tent, deep in thought
A picture of his wife and children back home in the United States
Rested on a table nearby

His mind began to wander across the miles
Back to other Sunday mornings that seemed so long ago
Now and so far away, he thought of home
And he knew that when this day dawned in America

His family would go to church to pray for his well-being
And his safe return
The young soldier reached into his bag and he took out
A deck of playing cards

He began to spread them out across his bunk
About that time, one of his buddies came by and said
""You gonna get up a game?"", ""No,"" the soldier replied
""I'm gonna spend a little quiet time with the Lord""

""Looks like to me you're playing cards,"" his friend said
""No, you see, I don't have my Bible and since we can't
Display our religion in public, here, I brought along this deck
Of cards"" and with that, the young boy started his story

You see when I look at the Ace, It reminded me
That there is but one God and the Deuce reminds me that
The Bible is divided into two parts
The Old and the New Testaments

When I look at the Trey, I think of the Father, the Son
And the Holy Ghost
When I see the Four, I'm reminded of the four Evangelists
Who preached the Gospel

There was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
And when I see the Five, I think of the five wise virgins
Who trimmed their lamps, there were ten of them
Five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out

And when I look at the Six, I'm reminded that in six days
God made this great heaven and earth
The Seven reminds me that on the seventh day
God rested from His great work

When I see the Eight, I think of the eight righteous persons
God saved when He destroyed this old world
There was Noah, his wife, their three sons and their wives
And when I look at the Nine, I think of the lepers
Our Saviour cleansed

And nine out of the ten, didn't even thank Him
And when I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments
God handed down to Moses on the table of stone
When I look at the King

It reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven
God Almighty
The Queen reminds me of the Blessed Virgin Mary
Queen of Heaven and the Jack or Knave is the Devil

When I count the number of spots on a deck of cards

I find 365, the number of days in a year
There's 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year
There's 4 suits, the number of weeks in a month
There's 12 picture cards, the number of months in a year
There's 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter

So you see, my friend
This deck of cards serves me as a Bible
As an Almanac and as a Prayer Book

And friends, this story is true

Won't do the things they think I should

Got to get your mind out of my head

Times are hard but I don't care

Just why I choose to be my own man
It doesn't matter I ain't gonna change
The master plan should be rearranged
Breaking rules is what I do
On the bad side it's a better view
If it's too loud then you're too old

Your blonde hair's rushing all around you

54097,Gary Moore,"They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

They marched him to the station house
He waited till the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged

""You stand accused of robbery""
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Just where he'd been that fateful night
A secret it must stay

He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms again he'll be
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills and
Over the hills and
Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms again she'll be

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
As sure as the river reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be

An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

Stepping out on a Friday never leave you behind

There ignored and defeated by the government
There's an oriented public whose magnetic force will pull
But away from the potential of the individual

And eddies of new ideas are increasingly hard to find
You need all that the other has, it's your right to seize the day
But in all your acquisitions you will soon be swept away

Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain

A reverberating chorus that anyone can hear
It sings 'leave your cares behind you, just grab tenaciously'

And nowadays he don't even hug you (doubts)
And I'm sure it do more than bug you

But that don't mean you 'bout to be Adam and Eve
In the Garden of Eden, but maybe for the evening
You say she leading you on, but you just added pressure
Of course she like you, you're friends don't try to test her
She says she likes you as a friend, not a lover or wife
So get a life, let her live hers and find another
Don't let her smash her ego, cause we know you're great

Here comes the man with concussions in his pocket.
Here comes the man with a laser-guided rocket.
Here comes the man with a fistful of pills so you can kill with no remorse,
With no recourse, dance on your conscience until it's a corpse.
War never ends.
War never begins.
Hoist up the hag of destitution!
His mouth's an empty room where wild woes wander.
Young machetes in lingerie charm us all into a frenzy.
His mouth's an empty hole full of quadriplegics.
Here comes the man.
So you charge into battle, muscles rippling, tanks tingling.
Before you fire a shot a white flash feels up your flesh
And cloaks you in a robe of blood, maydays you in a ship of mud.

Hoist up the hag of destitution!
His mouth's an empty room where wild woes sleep sow.
Young machetes in lingerie charm us all into a frenzy.
His mouth's an empty hole full of quadriplegics.
They left you for dead in the desert haunted with the ghosts of prostitutes.
They want you!
They want you!
Dress my corpse up in a low-cut dress.
Drizzle lipstick on my charred french kiss.
Dip my severed jaw in cheap cologne, push-up bras dangling from snapped elbows.
But death's just death no matter how you dress it up.

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last

Will I always be here spinning my wheels
Or does misfortune have a hand in the deal

I want to believe in a nurturing love
And not just a sacrifice

It simply is another way of saying ""this or that"". 
Let's examine the term ""this or that"" in its ultimate form which is: 
""This"" means the truth or ""that which is resistant to it. 
When a minority realizes its similarities on a higher level- not just ""black""- 
But people of color, and higher still ""indigenous"", 
And even higher still, ""from the tribe of."", 
And yet higher- the ""Rainbow Children"". 
When this understanding comes, 
The so-called minority becomes a majority in the wink of an eye. 
This action will cause a reaction or resistance. 
The source of this resistance must be banished as it is in direct conflict 
With the initial action. it cannot be assimilated, 
For its very nature is resistance.

Unhappy with the riches

And gathered up my fears to guide me round
But then I clearly saw my own delusion
And found my struggles further bogged me down

In starting out I thought to go exploring
And set my foot upon the nearest road
In vain I looked to find the promised turning
But only saw how far I was from home

In searching I forsook the paths of learning
And sought instead to find some pirate's gold
In fighting I did hurt those dearest to me
And still no hidden truths could I unfold

The ladies is out, lookin' fly, dressed comfortable
I love to wake up, and feel the breeze through my window
Slip on a fatigues, grab a dutch and roll some indo
It be days like these, that make life so much easier
Fish thawin' out, Guinness Stout in the freezer
Walk the block at my leisure (my leisure)
Summertime is like a anesthesia
So many pretty things to please ya
The greenery
Beautiful birds, natural scenery
Or even just a infinite sky
We be forever puffin' lah
On the block, or tellin' jokes in the ride (ha ha ha)
When the weather be hot, everybody be outside (whut)
Havin' fun (aight?), eatin' fresh fruits and vegetables
And good food put me in the mood for a festival
Some say the summer make a woman more sexual (s'up, boo)
It's instinct -- that's why my game be right on schedule
I put the great Mother Nature on a pedestal
She always fly, but today, she's exceptional
If I had a chance to make a wish
Every day would be just like this, full of Happiness

I feel great
Even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin'

Leavin' my bad times behind

To everybody who got a birthday today
Happiness (Happiness)

Have you ever heard the children play?
Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a j, and get away
Put some food on the grill
And just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
'Cuz it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune, 'cuz it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh), a day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out, all night to sunrise
Celebration of life, 'cuz every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to (uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind (whut)

53746,Garth Brooks,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be
'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain

She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright

Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered ""That's alright""
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace

And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing with the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I swear inside I feel
Her hungry arms again
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder

Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
Rushing in long in the wind

You better be alone
No I'm not obsessed

Is to tell you the truth that your ending is near

Lost tonight with the freezing toes
In the dark with the rain drenched clothes
She's all the way down

The sky has cleared, stars are bright
Temperature's gonna fall tonight
In the park looking for a light
She's in a hospital gown

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
It's another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'll say

Some drink wine, some are smokin' crack
This lady all alone wants none of that
In the park with a cart and sack
Afraid she's gonna drown

A choice she made not long ago
Has led to this, how could you know?
The door slammed shut, her children go
To whatever life they've found

Underneath the stars, what's it going to be?
In the house of mars, stranded by degrees
Hunger in the night, answered with a prayer
See the passing cars, there's nobody there

Now the clergy have their doubts
Are they helping lazy layabouts?
Late at night the drunken louts
Terrify the town

The cops are young, well, they're just kids
They don't know about the skids
They just do what the gentry bids
From the other end of town

Underneath the stars, who will crack the seal?
Waitin' here to die, numbers on a wheel
Figures in the dark, crouch against the wall
Out here in the park there's no one to call

Asleep in the park rain or shine
A thousand crows on the telephone line
Ask her how and she'll say fine
She's all the way down

Dew drops shot like cannonballs
Crash on paper prison walls
Her heart stops beating and her breathing stalls
She's dyin' all alone

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
In another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'd say

So now you ask what can I do?
See and know, they're just like you
You could wind up in the blue
Beneath a pauper's crown

Don't be afraid, you'll be surprised
If when you look into their eyes
You find a soulful feeling rise
You're all the way down

Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'd say

Frowning into Shakespeare and practicing their smiles

Even underlining Nabokov

Looking up at their reflection on the other wall
With every new idea wondering if they've changed at all
And then they look away
It happens every day

Some will be outrageous, some have rarely shown
Some will walk in couples, some will walk alone

They stare and smile at me, at me

Grandma's quilts are homemade treasures
Mine brings joy that I can't measure
'Specially when it keeps me warm at night
When your quilt's been stitched with love & pleasure
Each day's burdens seem so light

(CHORUS)
Grandma's quilts are built to last
Heirlooms of the past
Grandma's quilts are carefully sewn with love
You know it was you she was thinkin' of
As she planned and stitched
Oh, how I wish Grandma's quilts
Would last forever
		
Amy took her quilt to college
Found that more than books give knowledge
Love of family? that can't be beat
Lyin' 'neath her quilt she made a pledge
She would never know defeat

Sister Kari joined the Navy
Found the quilt that Grandma made
She always shared but still her heart was torn
When her hard-up friend just had a baby
She lent her quilt to keep that baby warm

He used to plead for Dad's in the worst way
Bad dreams would fade as Dad's quilt lay on his head

Made a quilt for his own bed

I kissed the smile upon her face

Never dream that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered ""manana""

There in a veil of white by candlelight
She knelt to pray

Or else is waitin', the world is comin' to an end
Everyday is a storm or a flood, tsunamis, this shit ain't the norm
We got Katrina and Rita minds keep collapsing
With the fires and mud slides, I'm like whats happenin'
Got the kids in the school gettin' raped and molested
Under-funded, unprotected no wonder they tested
And the lowest percentage rate, 
In my city damn near the lowest in the state
You can equate that to the state funds 
That ain't breakin' down right,
Rich districts get more and poor ones less, and it just don't sound right
So I'm fittin' to pound right on the doors of my city hall
And kick them doors down, they killin' my city yall
We need to get my people back to where they should be
And since nobody else is gonna do it its gonna have to be me

If it was up to me, 
You wouldn't have no aids and you wouldn't have no H.I.V

And it ain't just with the drugs, 
We got more problems than just the dealers and thugs
They using lead based paint, and investments is killing us
We tell 'em to fix it up but they just ain't feelin' us
They rather kicks us out and tear it down to the ground
So they can put up a parking lot, a mall, or some condos
Condemn the whole place cause if you sell crack 
Shit the rest ain't do nothin' wrong, what the fucks up with that
They say one rotten apple can spoil the whole bunch 
But we talkin' bout some people not apples, this ain't lunch
Make me wanna punch a politician dead in his face
You say you represent my district, get your ass on the case
Development is good for the hood yeah thats what you tellin' us
But bitch you on the pay roll of the builders and developers
Fuck what you sellin' us, pipe dreams for suckers
You can take that around the corner to them other motherfuckers man

So much youth they sacrifice
Just to live in paradise
Play they tricks and tell they lies I know
Its hurting to see how they treat the poor
They have so much and still they still want more
I see my people everyday on the floor

Its time to educate the people man, free school and college
So everybody cross the border can get the same knowledge
 education leads to jobs and jobs kill poverty
And no more poverty means we makin' money obviously
Everybody makin' money everybody smilin'

Matter fact speakin' of eatin' lets feed the homeless in America
Let these motherfuckers handle their own shit
How am I gonna clean your house, and mine still dirty
How am I gonna feed your kids, and mine still thirsty
And speakin' of the kids we need to spend some more time with 'em
Cant turn 'em loose in the streets, cause they dying in 'em

31882,Doves,"10:03 on a fast train
A trick of light
Crossing my eye
A skyward plane
Calling out your name
Calling out your name

Like the last of those fires
We shall burn into the night
Like a moth to the flame
I will turn back again
Oh I'm coming home
Calling out your name
All I've ever known

Distant call down the wire
Distant train on the line
I'll return to your side
With the push and pull of the tide
All I've ever known
Calling out your name
Oh I'm coming home

33723,Metal Church,"Why don't you find a worthwhile cause to channel your energies?
Like finding a solution to starvation and disease
I know that you're concerned about your First amendment rights
But don't you burn our flag to make your point, that's just not right
If you think you're better off in a different country
Why don't you pack your bags right now
Here's your ticket
It's on me

I've been around this whole wide world and found no better place
And no one's gonna start a fire in my homeland's face
We have a tendency to take our freedom for granted
We have some problems, yes I know
Look at the seed you've planted

I know that you're aching to be heard
What gives you the famous final word?
To think that your opinion is preferred
What gives you the famous final word?

What other country do you know that pays you without work?
When you need some money, see your welfare officer
There's a lot of other things that you could take a stand about
So you and your activists can take the next train out

I know that you're aching to be heard
What gives you the famous final word?
To think that your opinion is preferred
What gives you the famous final word?

Freedom of speech out of hand
Demonstrations in the land
If you complain a little more
What rights you have left
Go flying out the door

Why don't you find a worthwhile cause to channel your energies?
Like finding a solution to starvation and disease
With all the problems in this world that are facing us today
We need a concentrated push or in the long run we'll all pay",The Final Word,['fear'],13720,heavy metal,{'anger': 0.5952915549278259}
60024,Moya Brennan,"Look at me standing here, nothing to see
Speak to me, say the words, nothing I can hear
Take a while by my side, nothing to fear
Am I alone again?

Black night upon the sea
I will follow you
I see the fire in your eyes
True reflection, dusty skies

Look at me standing here, nothing to see
Speak to me, say the words, nothing I can hear
Take a while by my side, nothing to fear
Am I alone again?

White lies ride on the wind
Did I follow you?
I heard the silence everywhere
Foolish whispers fill the air

Look at me standing here, nothing to see
Speak to me, say the words, nothing I can hear
Take a while by my side, nothing to fear
Am I alone again?

Look at me standing here, nothing to see

That mean a lot 
They say, say
I love you.

Important words 
That's all I've got 
They say, say 
I love you.

The days, the nights, the hours 
We spent makin' plans
Have made both of us feel the same
Since we first held hands...

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
